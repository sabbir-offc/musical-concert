title:based on title about music concert.
details: write details about 250 word based on title
concert_price: your can add any price between 500 $ to 1000 $ and it only in int format


and also need anotheer fake data wher you listed 4 musician name. and give a name and a unique id that also added in the first data name is artist_id.
So my plan is that when visitor click on a artist then the data will be showed under this artist.
